To run a script containing directives to start parallel jobs you need sbatch command. Example running in parallel at HPC with a script "sources/part_01/cavity_hpc/run_hpc.sh"

  $> sbatch run_hpc.sh

Check your job status
  $>squeue --me

Stop running job:
  $> scancel <job_ID> (job_ID is obtained with squeue command)

List HPC partitions:
  $> sinfo
