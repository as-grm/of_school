# OpenFOAM school - 2. day

**Content**

1. Introduction to FVM mesh design
2. Basics of **BlockMesh** mesh generator ([page link - section 5.4](https://doc.cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide-v11/index))
3. Basics of **GMSH** mesh generator ([page link](https://gmsh.info))
4. Introduction to turbulence, turbulence modelling and RAS turbulent models in OpenFOAM
5. Demonstration of advanced case:
   - geometry: flow around a cylinder
   - mesh: generation with BlockMesh and GMSH; comparison of results between both
   - simulation:
     - steady case study with $k-\omega$ SST turbulent model
     - transient case study with $k-\omega$ SSTSAS turbulent model
