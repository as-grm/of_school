To run the GMSH case, the GMSH application should be installed on the system.

There are two ways:
1. GMSH is part of the module system: ml gmsh (check if it exists: ml av gmsh)
or
2. Install local instance:
  - create local Python env in the same folder as of_shool is
  - be careful not to be in a collision with the OpenFOAM module loaded Python version
  - in local Python env install gmsh
  - after in gmsh/run_all.sh it must include the source of local/bin/activate

!!! The best option is 1. !!!
