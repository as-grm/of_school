1. Must prepare the case:
    $> ./prepare_case.sh

2. Run the case on HPC:
    $> sbatch run_hpc.sh

File run_hpc.sh runs the problem in parallel on a dedicated node or nodes. In OpenFOAM, parallel decomposition is done with command "decomposePar", with dictionary file in "system/decomposeParDict".

IMPORTANT
In run_hpc.sh must specify the number of jobs to run, and the same number must be in decomposeParDict file!
