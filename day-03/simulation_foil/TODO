1. Mesh update: optimize mesh design based on y+ parameter for near wall layer thickness
2. PostProcess: 
  - review foil sample points access;
  - create python points search for closed loop
  - update python plot for Cl and Cd with respect to angle of attack
3. Add into presentation:
  - NACA00XX foil design description
  - calculation of force coefficients
  - effect on mesh generation and turbulent flow
